### food.py

In food.py, the 'food' for the snake will be created and will be given a random location in the play field. Also, a refresher method is developed in order to give
the food a new location every time it has been eaten by the snake.

### score.py

In score.py, I created the scoreboar for the game, which is located in the center in top of the play field. The methods; update_score and update_scoreboard,
increases the score by 1 every time the user manages to 'eat the food'. Method game_over will display "Game Over!" on the screen when the user has either ran into
the walls with the snake or bit its own tail. 

### snake.py

In snake.py the snake is been created. Next to this, its movements are congigured as well as the extension of its tail in case the snake eats the food. 

### Second version

In the newest version, an extra feature is added that keeps track of the user's all time high score. The code is located in the python files ending on v2.
